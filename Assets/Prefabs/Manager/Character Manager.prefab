  fullScriptsIntro:
  - "Hi there! My name is Charlie - I\u2019m 17 years old and love airplanes."
  - "I got my license to fly recently! And there\u2019s one airplane I love in particular\u2026
    My great-grandfather\u2019s P-51 Mustang!"
  - He was a Tuskegee Airman during World War II, when he piloted his P-51 Mustang
    for air battles.
  - "I\u2019m very proud of him! He was one of the first African American pilots
    in the United States Air Force."
  - "I\u2019m excited to fly his old plane. But\u2026 it\u2019s missing a few parts
    that got lost or damaged throughout the years."
  - I heard that this place has the parts my airplane needs. And that your talented
    team can help me fix the P-51 Mustang.
  - 'Each of you has been assigned a role: physicist, historian, or engineer.'
  - And each of you has been given a manual. Take your time to read it. Your manual
    will help you become an expert in your role.
  - "When you finish reading, press the button with your role on the screen. That
    way, I\u2019ll know you\u2019ve become an expert!"
  fullScriptsHunt:
  - "Awesome! You\u2019re a team of experts now!"
  - It looks like the parts for my airplane are scattered all over the place and
    protected by codes. You can see the part types and options in the Parts List.
  - 'Your storage can only keep one option for each part type: for example, you can
    only store 1 set of wings, 1 propeller, 1 engine...'
  - Make sure that the parts you collect are the right ones for the P-51 Mustang!
    You can do this by using your manuals and working together to solve the codes
    for the correct parts.
  - Let me help you with the first part! It is called the fuselage, or the body of
    the airplane.
  - "The fuselage\u2019s code is A\u2026 Can you find the marker with the letter
    A in the exhibit? It looks just like this."
  - When you find it, scan it with the tablet!
  - Fantastic job! The fuselage is now saved in the storage!
  - "When your storage fills up, you\u2019ll be able to assemble the airplane."
  - "Here\u2019s the catch! If you get a part that is not for the P-51 Mustang, you
    won\u2019t know it\u2019s wrong until you begin assembling the airplane."
  - "If any of your parts are incorrect, you\u2019ll have to go back to collecting\u2026
    So make sure you work together to get the right parts from the first try!"
  - "I think you\u2019re ready to start. I\u2019ll come back when you have all the
    parts!"
  fullScriptsAssembly:
  - Awesome, your storage is full! Tap the button to start assembling the airplane.
  - "WOW! The complete P-51 Mustang\u2026 ready to be flown!!! My great-grandpa would
    be so proud."
  - "I want to pilot it right away\u2026 Could you help me with this last step?"
  fullScriptsCollectReaction: []
  fullScriptsFly:
  - Tap the buttons to tell me when to take off and land my airplane.
  - "You\u2019ll see me up in the sky after I take off! And I\u2019ll come back to
    the ground when I land."
  - 'Oh, and you can also take photos with my airplane! I would love it if you did:
    you were the ones who fixed it, after all.'
  - "I can\u2019t thank you enough for your help and expertise. Your team is incredible!"
  - See you later!
